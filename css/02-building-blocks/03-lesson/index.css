/*
    The first two selectors are competing over the styling of the link's background color. The second one wins and makes the background color blue 
    because it has an extra ID selector in the chain: its specificity is 2-0-1 vs. 1-0-1.

    Selectors 3 and 4 are competing over the styling of the link's text color. The second one wins and makes the text white because although it has 
    one less element selector, the missing selector is swapped out for a class selector, which has more weight than infinity element selectors. 
    The winning specificity is 1-1-3 vs. 1-0-4.

    Selectors 5â€“7 are competing over the styling of the link's border when hovered. Selector 6 clearly loses to selector 5 with a specificity 
    of 0-2-3 vs. 0-2-4; it has one fewer element selectors in the chain. Selector 7, however, beats both selectors 5 and 6 because it has the 
    same number of sub-selectors in the chain as selector 5, but an element has been swapped out for a class selector. So the winning specificity 
    is 0-3-3 vs. 0-2-3 and 0-2-4.
